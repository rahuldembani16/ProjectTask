# CRUD Using codeignitor with SQLite Database

CRUD application using Codeignitor Framework with nice design

# Introduction Codeignitor Framework

Codeigniter is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Codeigniter attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, queueing, and caching.

# Start Project
So, from starting you must check config file to change base path of application
In this project, itâ€™s a simple crud option which you can use with nice design. We are SQLite database instead of MYSQL database in this project.
When you start the project, there is two option in side bar one is create new task and another is Task List.
In option one you can easily create task with its name and description with all validation server side and client side. I have restricted that task name and task description must contain at least 3 characters.
When you click on Task list it will display all task which you created in descending order there is two option in task list first is delete task and another one is edit task in which you can change name and description of task
